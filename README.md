### The Angular-Stash

Who
===
You, if you are an AngularJS developer or wish to become such.

What
====
Code, hopefully lots of it someday.  Services, Directives, and Filters as well as cool snippets to spice up your controllers and other modules.  Pull requests welcome!!!  You can also just inform me of you favorite Gists or raise and issue and I'll splice things in.

When
====
Uh...this repo started after v1.1 went live.  Temporal quantifiers are so juxtapositionally vexing.

Where
=====
GitHub.  And an Angular app near you.

Why
===
Not everyone knows everything...and I'm somewhere beneath the average.  So, it's nice having all of this stuff in one place!
